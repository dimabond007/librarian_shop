        "description": "This undergraduate textbook provides a broad overview of the ways in which ‘adventurous practices’ influence, and are influenced by, the world around them. The concept of adventure is one that is too often tackled within subject silos of philosophy, education, tourism, or leisure. While much of the analysis is strong, there is little cross-pollination between disciplines. Adventure & Society pulls together the threads of these discourses into one coherent treatment of the term ‘adventure’ and the role that it plays in human social life of the 21st century. It explores how these practices can be considered more deeply through theoretical discourses of capitalism, identity construction, technology and social media, risk-taking, personal development, equalities, and sustainability. As such, the book speaks to a broad audience of undergraduate and postgraduate students across diverse subject areas, and aims to be an accessible starting point for deeper inquiry.",

She is the reality behind all of the cherished notions of a divine mother throughout human history as well as the majestic source of the Holy Spirit, and of life itself. In this charming guide you will learn all about her and discover how she regards the unique challenges of being human. She will explain why our lives on this complex and sometimes dangerous planet offer an ideal setting for our adventures of soul growth. This book provides a selection of Mother Spirit's teachings from her many years of \"live\" transmission sessions, along with rich supporting materials. Her unprecedented and delightful instructions on the art of soulful living are more accessible than ever before.",

Chloe is enjoying activity camp and all the outdoor fun - what's not to like? But she can't understand why everyone goes on and on about \"leaving things the way you found them\". After all, what's the big deal about a bit of litter in the middle of the woods? The world is big enough for a bit of rubbish not to matter. But when she's given a mysterious compass with a fifth direction she's transported to a tropical island beach and has to brave the extreme conditions with the help of survival expert Bear Grylls. It's not like a typical trip to the seaside! First there's a shipwreck to escape through raging surf, fresh water to source, not to mention quicksand and sea urchins... Will Bear persuade her to change her ways when she sees how much non-degradable litter still washes up, and the damage it does to wildlife? And who will get the compass next? Each book in this fun new 12-book series from BEAR GRYLLS follows a different child on the outdoor activity camp. Once they are given the magical compass, they meet the inspirational adventurer in an amazing place and learn new skills and facts they can take with them back to their real life.",

        "description": "Sherlock Holmes, the world’s “only unofficial consulting detective”, was first introduced to readers in A Study in Scarlet published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887. It was with the publication of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, however, that the master sleuth grew tremendously in popularity, later to become one of the most beloved literary characters of all time. In this book series, the short stories comprising The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes have been amusingly illustrated using only Lego® brand minifigures and bricks. The illustrations recreate, through custom designed Lego models, the composition of the black and white drawings by Sidney Paget that accompanied the original publication of these adventures appearing in The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. Paget’s iconic illustrations are largely responsible for the popular image of Sherlock Holmes, including his deerstalker cap and Inverness cape, details never mentioned in the writings of Conan Doyle. This uniquely illustrated collection, which features some of the most famous and enjoyable cases investigated by Sherlock Holmes and his devoted friend and biographer Dr. John H. Watson, including A Sandal in Bohemia and The Red-Headed League, is sure to delight Lego enthusiasts, as well as fans of the Great Detective, both old and new. LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group of Companies. The LEGO Group has not been involved in nor has it in any other way licensed or authorised the publication of this book. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES: A young lady named Violet Hunter visits Baker Street seeking the advice of Sherlock Holmes on whether to accept a job as governess which commands a generous salary, but with some peculiar conditions. Two weeks after ultimately accepting the position, Miss Hunter calls Holmes to The Copper Beaches, an estate in Hampshire, to look into the singular, and at times terrifying, behaviour of her employers.",

He says all the wrong things, his family is falling apart, and everyone at school avoids him because of the very embarrassing Bird Brain Incident. But when Milton plays his video game Isle of Wild, he becomes someone else – Sea Hawk, the brave and brilliant naturalist explorer who conquers danger at every turn. Then Milton’s parents ship him off to the remote Lone Island for the summer. The island is chock-full of spectaculous species, and Milton realizes this is his chance to become the brave and brilliant naturalist he’s always wanted to be – and even meet some fellow explorers! But as it turns out, the future of the Lone Island is in some pretty serious peril, and the only thing that can save it is a field guide full of cryptic clues. So Milton and his unexpected new friends embark on a wild and wondrous adventure all of their own.",

There they are asked to help regain the fairy queen's wand that has been stolen by the magician Malicio. To help them retrieve the wand in safety, the queen gives them a potion that makes them invisible to everyone but each other. On their adventure, they meet a host of magic characters and are also able to rescue a pixie and a gnome, two prisoners of Malicio. As a reward, the queen gives the twins a magic stone that will enable them to return to Fairyland in the future. What other adventures await the twins?",

Do you love adventure stories with crisp dialogue, interesting history, and fun characters? Then Tortuga Gold will be your great discovery of the year. Imagine crossing Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt with John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. Now throw that hybrid into exciting adventures that only international best-selling thriller writer Wes DeMott could conjure up and... well, that weird bit of imagery actually gives pretty good insight into this first-in-a-series about Taz Keaton and the gang of Mayday Salvage and Rescue as they battle pirates in search of Blackbeard's great lost treasure. \"Mayday, you know. People only call us when things get really exciting.\" Love it. Tortuga Gold is a fun action story that follows Taz Keaton's fast adventures after he rejects his wealthy lifestyle and starts Mayday Salvage and Rescue in search of excitement. After Taz and his two partners race the Panamanian National Police to recover a metal case from the wreckage of a private jet in a muddy river, they meet a man with a coin from an historic but never recovered Spanish shipment that vanished in 1715. From there the adventure rolls from modern day pirates to blood-sucking leeches, exploding yachts to beautiful international competitors and a sea battle with the legendary Black beard himself. This is the first novel in a series involving Taz and Mayday Salvage and Rescue. Look for the second book in the series, Tequila Boom Boom, late summer 2012.",

In the middle of an intense game, a bolt of lightning strikes, sucking the three friends into the game! They discover that they’ve been transformed into their Minecraft characters. They try to escape, but they are trapped in the Overworld! While battling other players and hostile mobs, Simon, Michael, and Lily try to find a way home. Just when they are ready to give up, their town is attacked and Simon’s Minecraft home is destroyed. The friends now have to find out who is terrorizing them, and if the same person is responsible for trapping them in the game. If the trio can find and defeat the evil villain, will they finally be able to make a home in their favorite game? It’s a battle against an unknown enemy in this first installment of the new Unofficial Minetrapped Adventure series. Sky Pony Press, with our Good Books, Racehorse and Arcade imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of books for young readers—picture books for small children, chapter books, books for middle grade readers, and novels for young adults. Our list includes bestsellers for children who love to play Minecraft; stories told with LEGO bricks; books that teach lessons about tolerance, patience, and the environment, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.",

        "description": "On the Run in the Wild It was supposed to be a romantic canoe trip through a National Park. When things go horribly wrong, Phoebe is forced to run for her life. Alone with her dog in the canoe, she must face the truth of her past in order to survive. Can she trust her own fevered mind? Worried about her missing daughter, Kay will stop at nothing to find her. She joins forces with the Park Rangers to bring Phoebe back home. A gripping thriller full of adventure, faith and psychological twists that will keep you guessing. Thriller readers, like you, say, \"This book had me thinking about it long after the last page. Phoebe is a character you love to hate.\" Enjoy this excerpt: The smell of the gunpowder burns my nose in the enclosed space of the tent. The kick of the handgun knocked my arms hard, the butt of the gun slamming into my already probably-broken hand. My ears ring from the shot, dimming the cry from Ty, but not blocking it out completely. The single shout of surprise mixed with pain is forever etched in my brain. Another scar to carry. I scramble across the sleeping bags to the door of the tent. The zipper is run half way around, jammed near the top. I don't know why I thought the flimsy tent door would stop him from getting to me. In my panicked mind, I had room for only one thought. Get the gun to stop him. On my knees, I raise my face to the opening of the tent door and look into the night. The moon bathes our campsite, so bright the fading fire in the pit wasn't necessary. Ty just thought it would be romantic. My German short hair pointer sniffs at Ty's dying body near the dying fire. \"Get away from him, Rigsby,\" I command the dog. Always obedient, he whines and steps away from the body of my boyfriend. I watch Ty's chest closely to see if he's still breathing, still a threat. He lays still, his arms thrown wide, one leg bent, the other straight out. It reminds me of the sprawling way he hogs the bed at night. My hands shake so badly I have to fight the tent door zipper for a few moments until it slides down. The zipper is unusually loud in the quiet of the surrounding forest. \"Ty?\" I whisper, wondering if he's just playing, waiting for me to get close so he can pounce. The bloody stain on his chest is real. He's not playing. I climb out of the tent on hands and knees close enough to shake his foot. He doesn't moan, doesn't move. I've killed him. Sitting in the dirt next to the body of the man I loved, I brace myself for a flood of emotions. The emotions do not come. At least not the ones I expect. With my non-probably-broken hand, I touch my left eye. It's puffing up, swelling to a slit. \"You or me,\" Ty had growled only a few moments ago. I won this battle. I sit on the ground and stare a him. A stick is poking into my rear and the unmistakable feel of a bug crawls up my leg. A small beetle is ambling up my thigh. I take aim at the beetle with my forefinger and flick it away. It lands in the dying embers of the fire. The thought makes me smile. Then I throw my head back and laugh. Deep, painful peals of laughter shake my belly, rumble through my chest. Rigsby whines and cowers near the tent, no doubt thinking his momma has lost her mind. I stare at the moon, the bright white disk that sees all. Like an animal, I open my mouth and howl.

The words are written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern.

Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience",

You walk round and poke in wherever your fancy leads you, just like a kid in his own back yard, but everything is apparently so familiar that you just don't see it.\" \"I guess you're right,\" said Bobby thoughtfully. \"It never occurred to me to look at New York any more than to pick over my own ash-barrel. I've often been tempted by the ash-barrel next door, but --your own-- Look here, Madge: why should I try to see New York, and why should we be talking ash-cans when I've got you to look at in one of the most bewitching and abbreviated bits of dressgoods that ever revealed a completely adorable person? Tell me that.\" \"Well,\" said Madge, her face hardening, \"I will. It's a long story, not in words but in generations. The Van Telliers have lived in East Ninth Street since the year one of the island. That is, they used to live here; now they hardly exist. They are merely an assorted lot of animated corpses that crawl out of their tomb periodically to take a strange air, leaning on a rotten stave called the 'Old Order.'\" She flashed at him a look considerably older than her twenty-four years. \"The Old Order bores me to distraction,\" she went on. \"I'm not blind, and I'm too young to play the role of revenant and smack my lips over it. Listen to this, Bobby: the new New York is a fever, and I've caught it. I want a rainy-day car, a calling-car, and a touring car; I want dresses that will stab with envy the heart of every woman that looks at them; I want my jewels to run to size and quality, and I want a yacht just for the papers to talk about, because I hate to ride in the smelly things.\" Bobby's eyes had grown rounder and wider as the list...",

Just as in its significantly more popular predecessor, Robinson Crusoe (1719), the first edition credits the work's fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author. It was published under the considerably longer original title: The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Being the Second and Last Part of His Life, And of the Strange Surprising Accounts of his Travels Round three Parts of the Globe. Although intended to be the last Crusoe tale, the novel is followed by a non-fiction book involving Crusoe by Defoe entitled Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World (1720).",

On the pretext of making a film for his mother's environmental protection work, Jack wangles an expedition to the Arctic with his friends Amelia and Xander and cousin Caleb. But Xander's investigations into the mysterious backers funding their adventure raises Jack's suspicions. Is the renewable energy investment company really as environmentally responsible as it claims to be? While sledding with dogs, ice fishing, driving snowmobiles and sleeping in a self-made igloo, accidents beset them. Then disaster strikes when Caleb takes on a pack of wolves. Can Jack really trust his mother's friend Jonny Armfield to come to their help, or is he part of the problem?",

Then proper, correct Miss Violetta Beauchamps, a sprightly young thing of nine and sixty, crashes into her life. The Terrible Nephew is living in her rooming house, and Violetta wants him gone. Mrs. Martin isn’t about to start giving damns, not even for someone as intriguing as Miss Violetta. But she hatches another plan—to make her nephew sorry, to make Miss Violetta smile, and to have the finest adventure of all time. If she makes Terrible Men angry and wins the hand of a lovely lady in the process? Those are just added bonuses. Author’s Note: Sometimes I write villains who are subtle and nuanced. This is not one of those times. The Terrible Nephew is terrible, and terrible things happen to him because he deserves them. Sometime villains really are bad and wrong, and sometimes, we want them to suffer a lot of consequences.",

Fast Times and Excellent Adventures goes behind the scenes of a genre where cult hits mingled with studio blockbusters, where giants like Spielberg and Coppola rubbed shoulders with baby-faced first-timers and where ambitious future superstars Sean, Demi and Tom all got their big break. Music, comedy and politics - all play a part in the surprisingly complex history of the '80s teen movie. And while the films might have been aimed primarily at adolescents, the best tackle universal issues and remain a magnet to all ages. Time of your life, huh kid? From a late '70s Hollywood in flux to an early '90s indie scene that gave youth cinema a timely reboot, respected film expert James King smartly highlights the personal struggles, the social changes and the boardroom shake-ups that produced an iconic time in movie history.",

        "description": "\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\" is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as His Last Bow, and is the second and final appearance of Mycroft Holmes. Doyle ranked \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\" fourteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. The monotony of thick smog-shrouded London is broken by a sudden visit from Holmes' brother Mycroft. He has come about some missing, secret submarine plans. Seven of the ten pages - three are still missing - were found with Arthur Cadogan West's body. He was a young clerk in a government office at Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, whose body was found next to the Underground tracks near the Aldgate tube station, his head crushed. He had little money with him (although there appears to have been no robbery), theatre tickets, and curiously, no Underground ticket. The three missing pages by themselves could enable one of Britain's enemies to build a Bruce-Partington",

He decides he wants to visit Mount Rushmore and see the stone faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. Then he’ll ski the silky slopes of the Swiss Alps. And after that, he’ll ride an elephant in South Africa on a safari. Santa is eager for a new adventure, but Mrs. Claus isn’t so sure he’s ready just yet. Before he takes off, she’s going to make sure he’s got his rock climbing gear. And his skis, and his hat. He must be ready! It isn’t long before Santa realizes that maybe his adventure would be more fun with a friend. Mrs. Claus is clearly an expert adventurer herself, and so the two take off together on a runaway adventure. They have a little time before Christmas, after all, and everybody needs a break sometimes! Sky Pony Press, with our Good Books, Racehorse and Arcade imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of books for young readers—picture books for small children, chapter books, books for middle grade readers, and novels for young adults. Our list includes bestsellers for children who love to play Minecraft; stories told with LEGO bricks; books that teach lessons about tolerance, patience, and the environment, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.",

Beginning with the Roman army's first recorded encounter with the Gauls and ending with the gilet jaunes protests in the era of Emmanuel Macron, each chapter is an adventure in its own right. Along the way, readers will find the usual faces, events and themes of French history - Louis XIV, the French Revolution, the French Resistance, the Tour de France - but all presented in a shining new light. Graham Robb's France: An Adventure History does not offer a standard dry list of facts and dates, but a panorama of France, teeming with characters, full of stories, journeys and coincidences, giving readers a thrilling sense of discovery and enlightenment. It is a vivid, living history of one of the world's most fascinating nations by a ceaselessly entertaining writer in complete command of subject and style\"--Publisher's description.",

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was born in Scotland and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. After his studies, he worked as a ship’s surgeon on various boats. During the Second Boer War, he was an army doctor in South Africa. When he came back to the United Kingdom, he opened his own practice and started writing crime books. He is best known for his thrilling stories about the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. He published four novels and more than 50 short-stories starring the detective and Dr Watson, and they play an important role in the history of crime fiction. Other than the Sherlock Holmes series, Doyle wrote around thirty more books, in genres such as science-fiction, fantasy, historical novels, but also poetry, plays, and non-fiction.",

        "description": "Emerson Hough (1857-1923) was an American author, best known for writing western stories. Hough graduated from the University of Iowa with a law degree. He moved to White Oaks, New Mexico, and practiced law there but eventually turned to literary work by taking camping trips and writing about them for publication. He is best known as a novelist, writing The Mississippi Bubble (1902) as well as The Covered Wagon (1922). Hough was also a conservationist, and was the catalyst behind a law passed by the U. S. Congress to protect the buffalo in Yellowstone National Park. His other works include The Singing Mouse Stories (1895), The Girl at the Halfway House (1900), The Law of the Land (1904), Heart's Desire (1905), The Way of a Man (1907), 54-40 or Fight (1909), The Purchase Price (1910), The Man Next Door (1917), The Passing of the Frontier (1918) and The Sagebrusher (1919).",

Mrs. Warren comes to 221B Baker Street to ask for Sherlock Holmes' help after a new tenant moves into her rooms. The gentle landlady is concerned that her tenant isn't all he first appeared to be. After requesting to pay double the current rent on the condition of getting the room on his own terms, the tenant hasn't been seen. He leaves requests in notes on a chair outside his door, and this is also where he collects his meals, but Mrs. Warren is concerned that something darker lurks behind these curious circumstances. First published in 1911, 'The Adventure of the Red Circle' is a thrilling and suspenseful story, not to be missed by fans of detective fiction. This edition features a specially commissioned introduction alongside an article by Arthur Conan Doyle.",

S. Eliot called Huck \"one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet.\"The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: \"natural\" man versus \"civilized\" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, and other topics. Most of all, Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful story, filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters.",

Then a telegram from Melbourne, Australia intrudes into his grief. \"Come at once if convenient.\" Both suspicious and desperate to believe that Holmes may not, after all, be dead, Watson goes as immediately as the sea voyage will allow. Soon Holmes and Watson are together again, on an adventure through Bohemian Melbourne and rural Victoria, following a series of murders linked by a repulsive red leech and one of Moriarty's lieutenants. But things are not as they were. Too many words lie unsaid between the Great Detective and his biographer. Too much that they feel is a secret. Solve the crime, forgive a friend, rediscover trust and admit to love. Surely that is not beyond that legendary duo, Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson?",

        "description": "Phillip Carson, Indiana born and raised, is faced with the decision of moving to California in early adolescence for the sake of his mother’s health. He follows his parents to the Los Angeles area, where the adventure of his life begins. There he meets Susan Giles, a light in his life during the more innocent time of high school. They become an item, and she returns to his life post-college when he is dealing with three adversaries and his own internal struggles. During the eleventh grade, Phillip also meets retired fireman William Jones. William became a positive influence in other people’s lives after suffering a huge loss and trying to make the right decisions going forward. He commits his retirement years to reaching out to inner-city juveniles and later becomes a good friend to Phillip. Phillip learns from William and must later grow in his own faith to complete the challenges set before him. This is a story of the shadows of strife being overcome, and virtue left standing.",

        "description": "The academic study of adventure tourism is rapidly increasing in popularity, with research beginning to focus on it heavily. This book is a cohesive and comprehensive look at this multi-million dollar industry sector from a variety of perspectives relevant to the teaching of tourism. Ideal for the undergraduate student taking adventure tourism as a single subject degree or as part of their tourism management studies, this book documents, analyzes and offers insight into the latest research in the area. It includes analysis of products, trends, climate change, risk management and environmental management and many others. The 'Subsectors' section within the book offers an overview of the twenty or more definable sectors within the adventure tourism industry considering their origins and history, latest trends and demographic groups. The author then goes on to look in more detail at: Wildlife Tourism, Marine Tourism, Helitourism, and Boardsports. Each chapter will include seven pedagogical elements: introduction - what the chapter does and doesn't cover plain-language review of the chapter topic with minimal referencing - essentially like lecture notes concluding paragraph to the review section explaining how it leads to the next chapter(s) review of recent research, condensed into tables where possible revision notes - a few pages of bullet points summarizing the review and research a sample set of assignment questions, three to six per chapter in some cases readings on relevant topics, condensed from previous publications.",

        "description": "Just do it. Anything you want in life, seriously, just do it. It is only you stopping you, and life is way too short to 'wait for the right time.' Wanting can be done slouched on the sofa, glass of gin to hand, watching strangers on YouTube fulfil their passions. Taking action means jumping in head first, doing whatever it takes, and chasing after your dreams until you succeed. You only get one life, you're not a cat, unless you identify as one, which is very possible this day and age. I'm an ex RAF firefighter. I'm currently a self-employed personal trainer, published author, yoga instructor, drone pilot and campervan driver. I've trekked across the desert from the Dead Sea to Petra. I've backpacked through Europe. I've road tripped New Zealand. I've visited Canada, New Zealand, Fiji, Jordan, Falkland Islands, Greece, France, Italy, Vatican City, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Croatia, Canary islands, Balearic islands, Poland, Slovakia, Netherlands, Slovenia, Czech republic, Hungary, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and England. I've climbed mountains, hiked miles and miles of coast line, battled the World's biggest obstacle course and participated in numerous charity walks and challenges. This is my personal story of adventure, challenge, heartbreak, love, achievement, and a lot of men and alcohol in between. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Review: This book shows narration at its best. We are put in the front row to witness the life of a lady in her twenties as she embarks on various journeys, careers, and adventures, meets people, falls in and out of love, and achieves numerous things along the way. The language is vast and raw, which, in turn, creates humour. We see two parts of a woman-the will to make something out of everything, and the crazy, fun, party monsters many women usually are. In a nutshell, one can be at both sides and still turn out great.",

        "description": "Varisia has been destroyed! Runelord Alaznist's alteration of the past has thrown the frontier nation into chaos, devastated cities, resurrected demon lords, and worse. The Runelord of Wrath is now primed to seize control of a ruined realm, so that she can remake it into a New Thassilon with herself as its furious queen. Only one desperate plan can set things right-a band of heroes must discover a method to travel back in time and repair the damage their enemy has wrought on history, but can they make the sacrifices necessary for victory? This adventure allows the heroes to reach the absolute height of power, but even the potent options gained at 20th level may not be enough for the party to survive the furious might of Runelord Alaznist in her seat of power! This volume of Pathfinder Adventure Path concludes the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path and includes: - \"Rise of New Thassilon,\" a Pathfinder RPG adventure for 17th-level characters, by Greg A. Vaughan. - A brief exploration of how the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path will change Golarion in the future, including the first-ever map of the empire of Thassilon as it stood before the devastation of Earthfall, by James Jacobs. - A bestiary of monsters, including undead salamander forgemasters, living landslides, the mysterious hallowed lynxes used by runelords as pets and guardians, a planar dragon from the tumultuous Maelstrom, and the immense Great Old One Mhar itself, by John Compton, Andrew D. Geels, Lyz Liddell, Luis Loza, and David Schwartz.",

        "description": "\"No archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades. Right merrily they dwelt within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King's venison, washed down with draughts of ale of October brewing.\"Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelt apart from other men, yet they were beloved by the country people round about, for no one ever came to Jolly Robin for help in time of need and went away again with an empty fist.\" Pyle takes the reader along with Robin Hood and his band on their merry adventures. They tell of Little John, Will Scarlet, and Allan a Dale, and how they came to join the band; how Robin Hood escaped the arrows of the grim Sheriff of Nottingham, and later revenged himself; what happened at the court of the gentle Queen Eleanor. The tales go on to tell of Little John as a barefoot friar, and Robin Hood as a beggar; the chase by the quick-tempered Henry II; a visit from the good King Richard of the Lion's Heart; and all the other exploits of Robin Hood and his band. This is the best version of the classic stories and the only edition that reproduces both the original (1883) Pyle text and the famous Pyle illustrations in their entirety, including the page decorations. A favorite for generations, it will be welcomed again by parents and children alike in this sturdy paperback edition.",

With topics ranging from early classics like Donkey Kong and Super Mario Bros. to more recent hits like Plants vs. Zombies, the eleven essays in Music in Video Games draw on the scholarly fields of musicology and music theory, film theory, and game studies, to investigate the history, function, style, and conventions of video game music.",

The Babylonians recorded that beings they called the Oannes were amphibious creatures who came to Earth for the welfare of the human race. The historian Hellandus describes them as having fishlike features but the head, feet, and arms of a man. They instructed humans in everything a civilized nation should know. They built a city beneath Antarctica near the Davis Sea and have lived there peacefully and secretly ever since. But now a rogue Dwarf Star called Zarama threatens the very existence of both Earth and the home planet, Nazmos. Their mythology predicts that a being from another planet will avert disaster. Enter Ashley Bonner into this scenario. He has been granted special gifts, and the Oannes think he may be the predicted one. Can Ashley really prevail against a star a third more massive than the sun? This is the story of Ashley’s development to manhood from age four to seventy and his ultimate sacrifice to save both worlds. —C. J. Harvey",

The Central American Sea Kayak Expedition 2000 is an inspiring journey of exploration, endurance, and self-discovery that takes Jean-Philippe Soulé and his traveling partner Luke Shullenberger from Baja California all the way to Panama.

This riveting memoir of physical and emotional endurance will leave you breathless as you experience their victories, misfortunes and sacrifices. An evocative, gripping narrative coupled with award-winning photographs that is a must-read for those who love travel, outdoor adventure, and cultural exploration--and for the dreamers who've been told they can't, but stubbornly refuse to listen.",

The most celebrated (and furry) star in the Overworld, he’s the person others look to for help building their dungeons, mazes, and castles. He has a girlfriend, LadyBacc, and his most prized possession of all—a diamond axe called Betty. One day, Bacca is approached by a mysterious dragon . . . made entirely of diamonds! The dragon is from a new biome—a secret land few have ever seen—where a special object has been stolen. A seemingly impossible set of riddles and challenges stands in the way of getting it back, but if Bacca can help, the dragon promises he’ll receive a new weapon even better than Betty. Is he willing to risk everything and push his crafting skills to their very limits? As his millions of YouTube fans already know . . . of course he is! He’s Bacca! Perfect for Minecraft fans of all ages, Bacca and the Riddle of the Diamond Dragon showcases the YouTube Minecraft star that fans around the world have come to love: funny, creative, and just a little bit crazy!

Our list includes bestsellers for children who love to play Minecraft; stories told with LEGO bricks; books that teach lessons about tolerance, patience, and the environment, and much more.

As humans, we have evolved over millions of years to live with uncertainty and danger. That ability to adapt is what has made us so successful. In the past, life was hazardous, an adventure to survive. As wealth increased, adventurers set out to explore the world.

When Ava returns home discouraged, her dad steps in to help. Together, they build an airplane so she can follow her dream. But there's just one problem-the mighty little aircraft has a mind of its own! After taking off for a short test flight, they soon realize that the plane has other plans. When they narrowly miss crashing into the Eiffel Tower, they realize that they are far, far from home. Wanting to make the best of an unexpected situation, the father and daughter duo explore some of France's most iconic sights before finally flying home. Soar with Ava as she experiences new countries and cultures. Follow her as the little plane takes her on one amazing adventure after another. Ava's adventures are sure to entertain and educate young readers while showing them that they, too, can achieve anything and that the sky really is the limit when you follow your dreams.",

The ghost revealed itself, but turned out to be a time traveler from the 48th century with a warning of grave danger and an invitation to take a life altering trip to the far future of human society, beyond war and pestilence and into the next ice age. In our future, he learns of advanced technologies and our need to survive.Time Born is the first of several journals of Richard's many trips into our future. We, here in our time, think of ourselves as the ultimate in human development and technical expertise. Richard soon learns differently. He is constantly surprised and amazed at how human society has both willingly and unwillingly changed to enable survival in the frigid new world of the 48th century. A new ice age has turned most of planet Earth into a huge deep freeze. Bigger, stronger and more mentally developed humans have moved underground into a highly mechanized socialistic society. Richard, at first, finds it difficult to cope with, but reluctantly and gradually begins to see it as somewhat beneficial.Humans of the 48th century freely roam the universe by way of a complex transmission system capable of moving people and material from one far-off planet to another as easily and quickly as we of our time make cell phone calls.But not all was rosy in the paradise of 48th century. Someone, a party or parties unknown want Richard Remington dead and seem quite willing to do whatever it takes to make it so.",

        "description": "In the fall of 2007, the author thought he would head south for the winter with his RV and find a nice place to take a vacation from the cold. He had done volunteer work in the past and thought he might visit a couple of orphanages he had heard about from friends of his and see if he could be of assistance. It wasn't long before he was deeply involved with a group of fifty children 24-7 playing dad to many, and sharing in some events that were incredibly funny, and too many times heartbreaking. Reading this story will give you a feel for the politics, the reality of corrupt churches and the politics played with unfortunate children in that country we all know so little about south of the border. After returning for three winters to the southern Sonoran Desert to be with the huge family he had become a part of, bizarre events and political moves by the churches involved and the government bring the completely true story to a climax.",

Record your favorite or not so favorite trips and places here. There is room for weather conditions, terrain, the type of shelter you have, the food in the area (either what you bring or can find), trail markers, a small sketch area and even room for who was with you. After the initial survival log page there are 3 lined journal pages to take more detailed notes from your trip. There is room in this book to record 25 of your adventures. The picture on this book cover was taken on my own off the beaten path trip. I hope you enjoy all of your trips and adventures in the great outdoors.",

Without a father and separated from her mother, who’s looking for work, Peggy feels her unhappiness increasing until the day she and her uncle start digging a pond in the backyard and she realizes the rock she’s been trying to pry from the ground is really a human skull. Peggy eventually learns that her home and the entire seaside town were built on top of a 5000-year-old Coast Salish fishing village. With the help of an elderly archaeologist, a woman named Eddy, Peggy comes to know the ancient storyteller buried in her yard in a way that few others can – by reading the bones. As life with her aunt becomes more and more unbearable, Peggy looks to the old Salish man from the past for help and answers.",

It is set in the 1840 in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived as a boy. In the novel Tom Sawyer has several adventures, often with his friend Huckleberry Finn. Originally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best selling of any of Twain's works during his lifetime.Though overshadowed by its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the book is by many considered a masterpiece of American literature, and was one of the first novels to be written on a typewriter.\"",

        "description": "The genre of adventure games is frequently overlooked. Lacking the constantly-evolving graphics and graphic violence of their counterparts in first-person and third-person shooters or role-playing games, they are often marketed to and beloved by players outside of mainstream game communities. While often forgotten by both the industry and academia, adventure games have had (and continue to have) a surprisingly wide influence on contemporary games, in categories including walking simulators, hidden object games, visual novels, and bestselling titles from companies like Telltale and Campo Santo. In this examination of heirs to the genre's legacy, the authors examine the genre from multiple perspectives, connecting technical analysis with critical commentary and social context. This will be the first book to consider this important genre from a comprehensive and transdisciplinary perspective. Drawing upon methods from platform studies, software studies, media studies, and literary studies, they reveal the genre's ludic and narrative origins and patterns, where character (and the player's embodiment of a character) is essential to the experience of play and the choices within a game. A deep structural analysis of adventure games also uncovers an unsteady balance between sometimes contradictory elements of story, exploration, and puzzles: with different games and creators employing a multitude of different solutions to resolving this tension.",

He offered Hatherley a commission at a country house, to examine a hydraulic press used, as Stark explains, to compress fuller's earth into bricks. Stark warned Hatherley to keep the job confidential, offering him 50 guineas (�52 10s, an enormous sum at the time, worth over �4000 today). Hatherley felt compelled to take this work, despite his misgivings, as his business was newly established and he had very little work.",

You’ve just started your adventuring career, but already find yourself embroiled in a plot that sprawls from the shadows of Baldur’s Gate to the front lines of the planes-spanning Blood War! Do you have what it takes to turn infernal war machines and nefarious contracts against the archdevil Zariel and her diabolical hordes? And can you ever hope to find your way home safely when pitted against the infinite evils of the Nine Hells? • This heroic Dungeons & Dragons adventure book takes players from levels 1 to 13 as they journey through Baldur’s Gate and into Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. • Baldur's Gate is among the most iconic locations in fantasy culture. A mist-cloaked metropolis on the Sword Coast, it’s a place of history and a home to heroes. • The book introduces the infernal war machines to fifth edition D&D—battle-ready vehicles, which you can customize as you blast off into the Blood War. • Dungeon Masters will entice their heroes with devils’ deals, designed to lure adventurers with the ultimate temptations of power and treasure. • Created in 1974, D&D transformed gaming culture by blending traditional fantasy with miniatures and wargaming. Fifth edition D&D draws from every prior edition to create a universally compelling play experience",

        "description": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885. Commonly named among the Great American Novels, the work is among the first in major American literature to be written throughout in vernacular English, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry \"Huck\" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about twenty years before the work was published, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes, particularly racism.Perennially popular with readers, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication. It was criticized upon release because of its coarse language and became even more controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial stereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur \"nigger\", despite strong arguments that the protagonist, and the tenor of the book, is anti-racist.",

To wake up, we need to stop the noise, activate our senses, and re-wild our daily patterns. We all know deep down that we are built for more than sameness and screens. But how do we get there? How do we live a life that is meaningful and adventurous? In Awaken the Bear, Meier introduces readers to another path--one that is primal, untamed, and wild. Blending groundbreaking research with compelling personal stories, he challenges us to rethink the way we view ourselves and the natural world around us. Laying out a blueprint for well-being informed equally by cutting-edge research and timeless wisdom, Meier urges us to tap into our wild inheritance, suggesting that as our modern lives shift increasingly indoors, recognizing the benefits of nature has become more urgent than ever. The goal for all of us should be to approach life with excitement and zest, to feel alive and activated, and to live a life that is rewarding and authentic. But none of this happens on its own. There are levers that we need to pull, and we need to ask the right questions: Why and where are we meant to roam? What animates us? What challenges us? What sustains us? Awaken the Bear is an invitation to consider these questions and to open the door to a wilder and more meaningful life.",

From my earliest memories, flying aerobatics with my grandfather to years spent teaching people to take to the skies, I've had a lifelong fascination with flight.This obsession led my life on many adventures. From freezing motorcycle tours of Alaska, to crossing mountain tops in Czech Republic dangling from the lines of a paraglider, to founding several companies including Aviator Paramotor where I've spent the better part of the past decade helping people overcome their fears through flight.This book's focus is on accepting life as an adventure to be enjoyed and to choose to rise above your natural inclination to see yourself and your circumstances as a victim. Through many injuries, failures, and massive pain, I've been blessed to continue to grow ever forward and it is my honor to share some of my story with you.It is my hope that after sharing in my experience, you will see a new way forward. A new way to say \"Farewell to Normal\".",

        "description": "Drive . . . and grow rich! The bestselling author of Investment Biker is back from the ultimate road trip: a three-year drive around the world that would ultimately set the Guinness record for the longest continuous car journey. In Adventure Capitalist, legendary investor Jim Rogers, dubbed “the Indiana Jones of finance” by Time magazine, proves that the best way to profit from the global situation is to see the world mile by mile. “While I have never patronized a prostitute,” he writes, “I know that one can learn more about a country from speaking to the madam of a brothel or a black marketeer than from meeting a foreign minister.” Behind the wheel of a sunburst-yellow, custom-built convertible Mercedes, Rogers and his fiancée, Paige Parker, began their “Millennium Adventure” on January 1, 1999, from Iceland. They traveled through 116 countries, including many where most have rarely ventured, such as Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Angola, Sudan, Congo, Colombia, and East Timor. They drove through war zones, deserts, jungles, epidemics, and blizzards. They had many narrow escapes. They camped with nomads and camels in the western Sahara. They ate silkworms, iguanas, snakes, termites, guinea pigs, porcupines, crocodiles, and grasshoppers. Best of all, they saw the real world from the ground up—the only vantage point from which it can be truly understood—economically, politically, and socially. Here are just a few of the author’s conclusions: • The new commodity bull market has started. • The twenty-first century will belong to China. • There is a dramatic shortage of women developing in Asia. • Pakistan is on the verge of disintegrating. • India, like many other large nations, will break into several countries. • The Euro is doomed to fail. • There are fortunes to be made in Angola. • Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are a scam. • Bolivia is a comer after decades of instability, thanks to gigantic amounts of natural gas. Adventure Capitalist is the most opinionated, sprawling, adventurous journey you’re likely to take within the pages of a book—the perfect read for armchair adventurers, global investors, car enthusiasts, and anyone interested in seeing the world and understanding it as it really is.",

        "description": "\"Grandma Witch: Adventure Four\" is the fourth book in the Adventures of Alex and Katie series. In each of the books, Alex and Katie enter a different Russian fairy-tale and change the ending by their actions. In \"Grandma Witch: Adventure Four,\" they embark on the journey to rescue a little girl from the three-headed dragon. But they soon find out that the problems they are about to face are much more serious than they could have anticipated. Baba Yaga, the Russian witch, immersed the whole forest into total darkness by capturing the Guardian of Light and his horse. It is up to Alex and Katie to find the Guardian of Light and bring sunlight back into the forest. They have to be brave and clever as they cross dangerous rivers, find the hut on chicken legs, make potions, and learn what it means to be smart and kind. An exciting new book in the series! Other books are: Firebird: Adventure One Lollipop: Adventure Two Snowdrops: Adventure Three",

        "description": "This book provides a review of the current theory and practice of experiential tourism and how it is marketed. Many societies today are characterised by widespread individual wealth of an order previously confined to the elite with the consequence that ownership of ‘ordinary’ physical goods is no longer a distinguishing factor. Instead people are now seeking the ‘extraordinary’ with examples being bodies enhanced through surgery, personal fitness trainers, and, in the case of leisure and tourism, seeking unique and unusual places to visit and activities to undertake. This trend manifests in the increasing consumption of services and the addition of experiential elements to physical goods by businesses aware of societal changes. The trend is enhanced by rapidly changing technology and economic production methods providing new sectors of the world’s population with access to the consumption experiences that are repeatedly featured in the media. This is the experience economy, characterised by a search by consumers for fantasies, feelings, and fun. This book was based on a special issue of Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Mangement.",

        "description": "Ever since he was a geckling, P.D. Puddleskipper dreamed of exploring the world just beyond the Kapok tree. For P.D. life was more than simply gathering grubs and lounging about in the sun like other geckos. Life was an adventure! But not until a terrible metal beast attacks the Emerald Forest does he finally get his chance. Piloting his latest invention, an airship called the Puddlejumper, P.D. leads his friends, fellow lizard Flora Springtail, a tree frog named Blinky, and a sleepy tree sloth named Waffles on an incredible journey in search of a new home. Join the crew of the Puddlejumper as they bravely venture forth across the Emerald Forest, battling sticky-fingered fruit bats and slippery snakes, exploring far-away places, looking for lost treasure, and making new friends along the way. From Way-Up peak to the Rollie-Roo River, the Cave of Song to the Great Kapok Tree, P.D. and his friends learn the value of friendship through their exciting adventures.",

School was close to being out, and he had plans – BIG PLANS! His fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Magle, told the class that she had a fun surprise for the last day of school. What could it be? Well, let’s just say that Mrs. Magle and Gum don’t define “fun” the same way. Mrs. Magle announced to the class that she would be their teacher next year also. That wouldn’t be so bad, except she assigned everyone a SUMMER WRITING PROJECT! Gum doesn’t like this news! What’s he supposed to write about? He hates writing! How can he live out a summer of adventure with a writing project looming over his head? To make matters even worse, Gum’s mom is a teacher across the hall. How will he ever get out of this unfortunate mess? A summer must be savored and enjoyed. SUMMERS ARE FOR KIDS!",

        "description": "Peace Be Still: A Pugusaur Adventure II, is a continuation of the sci-fi comedy, Percy's Pet Pugusaur Pete, Bully Eradicator. In this story, Percy's best friend, Nelly, finds a new friend with rather unique qualities. Nelly's new friend's name is Peace, and there are two things Peace loves more than anything. Peace loves Bible scriptures and anything that relates to the flower child movement of the 1960s. One day, Peace comes across a Bible scripture that begins to speak to her spirit and resonate in her soul. As in most good scriptures, it provides her with just what she needs to hear at that moment. Peace obeys the scripture and allows the words to do the work. She accompanies Nelly to school one day and becomes the target of two bullies. Only the bullies have no idea what secrets Peace hides or with God what she is capable of. If they only knew, they would have quickly chosen another victim. This is a fun little story and not at all preachy. In fact, prepare yourself for a rather fun learning experience as you travel on another \"Pugusaur adventure.\"",

        "description": "Inspired by a true story, this charming tale follows two friends on a trip to visit the ancient island churches of Lake Tana in Ethiopia. But what they expected to be a smooth ride across the large lake in their little boat turns into an adventure when they are stranded in the water with the hippos! Written by mother-daughter team Ellenore and Leyla Angelidis, whose love of Ethiopia and passion for books inspired them to found Open Hearts, Big Dreams, a nonprofit devoted to increasing literacy in Ethiopian indigenous languages. Side by side text in Portuguese and English supports bilingual readers, and charming illustrations by Ethiopian artist Eyayu Genet bring the beautiful landscapes of Lake Tana to life. Open Hearts Big Dreams Ready Set Go (OHBD-RSG) Books were created to help increase the literacy rate in Ethiopia through giving readers books with stories in their heart languages, full of colorful illustrations with Ethiopian settings and details. Profits from book sales are used to create, print, and distribute more OHBD-RSG books to kids in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country. Ethiopia's population has a high percentage of children ages 0-14. Only a small percentage attend pre-school or kindergarten, and the adult literacy rate is around 50%. Some of our books are based on wise Ethiopian sayings that often rhyme in Amharic. If an adult says the first half, many children can chant the second half. Sometimes the meaning of these sayings is clear. Sometimes it has to be puzzled out and argued over. But sayings and idioms and proverbs help people express truths and beliefs in unusual ways. Other books are based on STEAM topics, cooking, colors, counting and more. Since late 2017, OHBD has published over 150 unique OHBD-RSG bilingual titles in a number of Ethiopian, African and global languages plus English and has plans to publish more titles and add more languages. New titles or languages are added monthly; follow our author page to get new release announcements. Open Hearts Big Dreams Fund (OHBD) is a 501(3)(c) not for profit organization that believes the chance to dream big dreams should not depend on where in the world you are born. Our mission is to inspire and enable youth in Ethiopia through Literacy, Innovation, Inclusion and Leadership Projects in collaboration with individuals and organizations in Ethiopia and globally.",

This book contains clear and playful illustrations exploring each yoga pose by mimicking animals and objects. The memorable rhymes for each character include plenty of learning opportunities linking to the changes we experience during autumn. At the end of the book are two autumnal themed gratitude and mindfulness activities. Practising the yoga sequence along with the activities will help improve your child's confidence and happiness as well as many physical benefits! The book can be read from front to back, or you may want to cut it up to use as flash cards. Nothing in this world is permanent after all. 'An Autumn adventure hangs in the air.Relax, unwind and I'll take you there. Breathe in, breathe out.Let your imagination run free.And come let's take a peak behind this tree.'",

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers. Generally, Trieste books are purchased singly - on demand, however they may also be purchased in bulk. Readers interested in bulk purchases are invited to contact us directly to enquire about our tailored bulk rates.",

VI THE ALCHEMICAL LABORATORY We went through a beautiful and broad corridor, all along whose sides stood finely executed marble statues representing the gods and goddesses of antiquity, and busts of the heroes of olden times. \"These statues,\" my companion remarked, \"represent the elemental principles and powers of nature, and they were thus personified by the ancients to bring the attributes of these principles within the conceptive power of the mind. None of the old Greeks and Romans, except the most ignorant, ever believed that Zeus, Pluto, Neptune, &c., were existing personalities; nor did they ever worship them as such. They were merely symbols and personifications of formless powers. Likewise, every man's form and body is not the real man; it is merely a symbol and personification of the character and attributes of the real man, a form of matter in which the thoughts of the real man have found their external expression. The ancients knew these things; it is only the modern wiseacres who mistake the external illusions for internal truths, and the form for the principle. It is modern materialistic religion which has degraded the Universal Spirit into a limited being, and the great powers of nature into Christian saints.\" We entered into a circular hall in the form of a temple. It had no windows, but received its light from a cupola of clear glass. High over our heads, below the cupola, was a large interlaced double triangle made of gold and surrounded by a snake biting its tail. In the midst of the room, and directly under that symbol, stood a round table with white marble top, in the centre of which was a smaller representation of the figure above, executed in silver. The walls were ornamented with bookcases, in which were a great...",

        "description": "THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYERThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is an 1876 novel about a boy growing up along the Mississippi River. It is located in the 1840s in the fictional city of St. Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived as a boy.Tom Sawyer lives with his aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid. He skips school to swim and is made to launder the fence the next day as punishment. He skillfully persuades his friends to exchange small treasures for the privilege of doing his job.Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl from the city, and persuades her to \"get engaged\" by kissing her. But their romance collapses when she learns that Tom was \"betrothed\" to Amy Lawrence before. Shortly after Becky rejected him, he accompanied Huckleberry Finn to the cemetery at night, where they attended a trio of body thieves, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter, and Injun Joe, entering a fight in which Robinson was murdered by Injun Joe.Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter, but the boys know he's innocent. At the Potters trial, Tom speaks up and Joe escapes through a window before he can be apprehended. Now, the boys live in constant fear of Joe's revenge on them to incriminate him.Bored at school, Tom, his best friend Joe Harper, and Huck flee to a Mississippi island called Jackson's Island. While appreciating their newfound freedom, they realize that the community is ringing the river for their bodies. Tom slips home one night to watch the commotion. After a brief moment of remorse at the suffering of his loved ones, he is struck by the idea of appearing at his own funeral. Later, the trio achieves this plan by making a sensational sudden appearance in the church in the middle of their common funeral service.Back at school, Tom finds himself in Becky's favor after nobly accepting blame and punishment for a book she tore up.MARK TWAINMark Twain, real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens, born November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri (USA) and died April 21, 1910 in Redding, Connecticut (USA), is an American writer, essayist and humorist .After a career as a soldier, printer and journalist for miners in Nevada, he became known for his novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and his sequel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885).From 1864, he worked as a reporter in San Francisco and moved to Europe as a press correspondent. After marrying Olivia Langdon in 1870, he moved to Hartford, Connecticut. He had 4 children including 3 daughters: Susan, Clara and Jeanne and a son who died prematurely. In his early novels, Mark Twain evokes his travels in Europe and Polynesia (The Journey of the Innocents, 1869) by mocking the prejudices and conduct of his compatriots, as well as his period as a researcher of gold and journalist on the Comstock Lode, in Hard Times (Mark Twain) (1872). Sent by his journal in Polynesia in 1866, Mark Twain spends 4 months, sympathizes with sailors and whalers, rents a horse, and notes the dramatic decline of the original population, Kanaka Maoli. He reports reports and a series of letters published by the Sacramento Union, and then collected in a book in 1947, Letters from Hawaii.It is thanks to his two novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) that he gains fame as a comic writer. Mark Twain, however, writes in the second part of his work more serious texts pessimistically denouncing the excesses of civilization and immorality erected in morality. The end of her life is clouded by financial troubles, as well as the death of one of her daughters at age 24 caused by meningitis and the death of his wife. He loses a second girl, aged 29, drowned in her bathtub after an epileptic seizure.",

What happens to this family as they meet each new experience makes a captivating adventure story told with wit and piety. Olson writes with such simple beauty of expression that a walk in the forest becomes an enchanting encounter with nature. And the terror of their four year old daughter seriously hurt, hours and untold miles from competent help, leaves an indelible imprint on the reader. The motivation to leave middle America with its comfortable homes, paved streets and shopping centers is a search for complete happiness. But the Olsons find more than personal fulfillment among the giant trees, towering snow-capped peaks, singing streams and a few dozen people very unlike themselves. They also find the presence, the power and the majesty of God.",

The trip exposes Malo to the diversity and richness of the world around him including the different cities, languages, clothing, countries, cultures, and foods. Along the flightpath, our young traveler also sees the different monuments and landmarks linked to the different countries along the route to Kenya. Malo sees the engineering wonder, California's own Golden Gate Bridge shortly after taking off. He wakes up several hours later to the majestic spiral of Big Ben and the Thames River as the plane flies over London. The southern and northern coastlines of the Mediterranean Sea signals Malo's exit from Europe and entrance into Africa respectively. Malo then sees the mighty Nile River snaking southwards with the great Pyramids in the background. It is an experience that provides Malo with a real-life Geography and History lesson. Read on to find out what lessons Malo learns as he travels back to Kenya, his father's country of birth; the same country where the late father of Barack H. Obama, America's first bi-racial and 44th president was also born....",

        "description": "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is the best known work of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832 - 1898) – better known by his pen name, 'Lewis Carroll'. Telling the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by surreal and anthropomorphic creatures, the book was a huge commercial success on its initial publication in 1865. It was followed by its sequel, 'Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There', in 1871. The books play at the heart of logical problems and literary nonsense – giving the narrative lasting popularity with adults and children alike. The story is accompanied by a series of dazzling, full-colour, Milo Winter illustrations. Winter (1888 - 1956), is best-loved for his animal drawings, and was among the artists working in the later stages of the 'Golden Age'. His work can be identified from its masterful accuracy, humorous touches, personality, and attention to detail. Winter produced artwork for such well-known tales as Aesop's Fables, Arabian Nights, Alice in Wonderland, and Gulliver's Tales. Presented alongside the text, his illustrations further refine and elucidate Lewis Carroll's captivating storytelling. This book, 'Alice in Wonderland - with Milo Winter illustrations' forms part of our 'Pook Press' imprint, celebrating the golden age of illustration in children's literature.",

        "description": "Maurice-Marie-Emile Leblanc (1864-1941) was a French novelist and writer of short stories, known primarily as the creator of the fictional gentleman thief and detective Arsene Lupin, often described as a French counterpart to Conan Doyle's creation Sherlock Holmes. The first Arsene Lupin story appeared in a series of short stories serialized in the magazine Je Sais Tout, starting in No. 6, dated 15 July 1905. Clearly created, at editorial request, under the influence of, and in reaction to, the wildly successful Sherlock Holmes stories, the roguish and glamorous Lupin was a surprise success and Leblanc's fame and fortune beckoned. In total, Leblanc went on to write twenty-one Lupin novels or collections of short stories. The character of Lupin might have been based by Leblanc on French anarchist Marius Jacob, whose trial made headlines in March 1905; it is also possible that Leblanc had also read Octave Mirbeau's Les 21 Jours d'un Neurasthenique (1901), which features a gentleman thief named Arthur Lebeau. Leblanc also wrote two notable science fiction novels: Les Trois Yeux (1919) and Le Formidable Evnement (1920).",

Born in East Tennessee, Crockett was a hunter and storyteller who became a colonel in the militia and later represented Tennessee in the U.S. Congress. A fierce opponent of President Andrew Jackson's policies, Crockett lost his seat in 1831 but was re-elected in 1833. When he narrowly lost again in 1835, he left for Texas, where he died fighting for independence in the Battle of the Alamo. Crockett's larger-than-life exploits became the stuff of legend, and he continues to be celebrated in popular culture today.",

        "description": "ÒYou want a yarn. You shall have one,Ó said a young friend of mine, a midshipman, who had just returned from a four yearsÕ cruise in the Pacific. ÒI am not a good hand at describing what I have seen, but I can narrate better the adventures of others which they have told me:ÑÓ We had visited a good many islands in the Pacific, engaged in settling the disputes of the natives or trying to settle them, punishing evil doers, supporting the consuls and missionaries, surveying occasionally hitherto unknown harbours, and endeavouring to make the British flag respected among the dark-skinned inhabitants of those regions. I with another midshipman and a boatÕs crew had landed on a beautiful island of the Western Pacific to bring off a cargo of cocoa-nuts and breadfruit with which the natives had promised to supply us. Two of our men had straggled off against orders into the interior. While waiting for them we saw the signal made for our return. Unwilling to leave them behind, we ourselves unwisely started off to look for them. The natives gave us to understand that they were a little way ahead, so we pushed on hoping to come up with them and bring them with us. A considerable time longer than we expected was thus occupied, and when having at length overtaken them we got back to the beach, we found that a strong breeze had set in, and that so heavy a surf was breaking on the shore that it would be extremely dangerous passing through it. Still the signal was flying and the order must be obeyed. We shoved off, but had not pulled many strokes before a succession of tremendous rollers came roaring in, turning the boat right over and sending her back almost stove to pieces on the beach. Had it not been for the natives who swam to our rescue, we should probably have lost our lives.",

        "description": "Until something goes wrong, we take our hearts for granted. Heart-Smart-Gurus, inspired by long research, point to that bright red Valentine in our chests, pumping tirelessly and endlessly on our behalf. But one day textbook cardiagram wiggles, veer off the chart and we are pronounced, however gently, cardiologically in-correct. We feel betrayed. We more or less, thought we were doing everything right so, whats gotten into our ticker, that loyal, lifeline friend? Time for one thing, heart sore for another, Hearts are only human after all. Whats a longevity-seeker to do, especially if blessed with enough heart-health insurance to make high-tech opportunities, breakdownaffordable? The concept of preventing heart ache, arresting it, or reversing it, is Valentines number one topic. For me its a question of flat out prevention, to heal the heart emotionally, via a softening process designed to protect the precious pump. Accumulation of blockage is what causes arterial malfunction. Deprived of emotional oxygen, our own hearts cannot dilate freely. Regular exercise may prevent an attack, and insure loves longevity. Superman has nobody, doesnt need a seat belt, nor even a plane. Are you flying solo? Be a friend. Find a lover. No man is an island. A centuries-old someone pointed out: Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief. When needed, good friends give major doses of encouragement on short notice, as do family supporters when trouble finds us. A circle of wagons is a supreme conductor for immediate shelter against stray enemy arrows. The John Wayne, strong, silent type, I dont need anybody and men dont show love mentality, isnt macho, man, but flat out stupid! In this writers paraphrase, Samuel Johnson admonished, If a man does not renew his friendships, and make new acquaintances, he finds himself playing alone as he grows, too-soon old and too-late smart. One must keep friendships in constant repair. Has your friendship grown distant, worn thin, been allowed to slip away? Do a bit of friendship repair with a welcome oil-change, and a few new points and plugs. Invite a friend or lover to do lunch: Whatever it takes, fix it: Whatever it needs, mend it: Whenever it bleeds, move on to a more worthy and willing recipient of your hearts affections. An old Scottish proverb states, He who ceases to be your friend never was a good one. In other words, with friends like you, who needs enemies? While youre at it, start at home with your significant other. Maintain this key friendship when it warrants home-improvement. Remember, your mate reads you like a book, which ought not be a mystery novel. Perhaps you need to uncover the tinfoil to let her read the introduction and to truly reveal your heart, by allowing her not just to scan but to study all its pages. A woman, who is allowed this look-see inside her mates heart, is the one who becomes and remains your life-long best friend, partner and home companion. A Promise Keeper, fueled by faith, fired with compassion and true to God, achieves unconditional passions for love of life, love of wife, of relatives and friends, co-workers, and parishioners, and has love to spare even for enemies. So turn the other cheek. The other kiss may be love-saving. To have a friend is to be one; its the beginning of relationships that lead to loves: paternal, filial, (described as fraternal), as in Philadelphia, (city of brotherly love), and Eros, even if the arrows point in alternate-lifestyle directions, and sex without love or marriage. Agape love, of course, is the ultimate love of our Creator for his Creation, leading to Eternal Love, if you will, that Father-God promises His children. To love one another as He loves us, is not a request, but a command, from the Nurturer who furnishes the glue to make it stick. Can you buy love? Sure, if youre shopping for a convenient kind, tried and untrue. You can only earn respect by modeling love. It is o",

This special unabridged BLACK & WHITE graphic novel edition is produced to mark the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Alice and the White Rabbit (\"I'm late!\"), the Cheshire cat (\"A grin without a cat!\"), the March Hare, Mad Hatter and Dormouse (treacle and twinkle) and the impassioned Queen of Hearts (\"Off with their head!\"): all are characters who have remained enchanting to both children and adults for a century and a half, and now a visual age can enjoy this enduring classic. Twenty years in the making, this is the first word-for-word adaptation that incorporates illustrations reminiscent of Sir John Tenniel's classic Victorian woodcuts. The art is rich and lavish, filled with hidden pictures and visual easter eggs. The unique, fully illustrated design will delight even the most reluctant reader! Be it your first time to Wonderland or a return visit, join in this celebration of 150 years of Alice.",

It explores how the various tourist destination systems including tourist, places (as seen by the tourist), public and private tourism organisations and the social and physical environment can effectively communicate and co operate together at a profit for each. Advances in Destination Marketing offers a comprehensive review of a wide range of aspects related to marketing tourism products including networks in destinations, consumer experiences in destinations, destination branding, destination image, events in destinations and destination tourism products. Throughout the book a network analysis perspective is applied to offer alternative solutions of how each system can share network knowledge and system knowledge so profits can be created effectively and maximised. The exploration of new topics such as Destination Networks and Destination Branding as well as original international empirical research and case studies from well known researchers in the area, provides new thinking on Marketing Tourism Destinations. The relevance of the arguments and the salient conclusions are valuable in the study of an ever dynamic and burgeoning industry. This stimulating volume will be of interest to higher level students, academics, researchers within Tourism and practitioners in the industry.",

It traces the social and moral representations of the period in extended readings of the major novelists, as well as evaluatiing the importance of lesser known ones. John Richetti traces the shifting subject matter of the novel, discussing: * scandalous and amatory fictions * criminal narratives of the early part of the century * the more disciplined, realistic, and didactic strain that appears in the 1740's and 1750's * novels promoting new ideas about the nature of domestic life * novels by women and how they relate to the shift of subject matter This original and useful book revises traditional literary history by considering novels from those years in the context of the transformation of Britain in the eighteenth century.",

It covers the major areas of chartering and bills of lading, as well as matters such as exclusion and limitation of liability. This edition has been comprehensively updated and adds the latest cases to its strong coverage of classic authorities. Notable additions in the chapters dealing with bills of lading include The Starsin, The Rafaela S, Motis Exports and The David Agmashenebeli. On the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, the important decisions of The Berge Sisar and East West Corp are incorporated, while key recent decisions on chartering, such as The Hill Harmony, The Happy Day and The Stolt Spur are fully treated. This book provides an up-to-date collection of materials relating to the carriage of goods by sea which will be of value to both students of law and legal practitioners.",

Online community has provided social researchers with insights into our evolving social life. As suburbanization and the breakdown of the extended family and neighborhood isolate individuals more and more, the Internet appears as a possible source for reconnection. Are virtual communities 'real' enough to support the kind of personal commitment and growth we associate with community life, or are they fragile and ultimately unsatisfying substitutes for human interaction? Community in the Digital Age features the latest, most challenging work in an important and fast-changing field, providing a forum for some of the leading North American social scientists and philosophers concerned with the social and political implications of this new technology. Their provocative arguments touch on all sides of the debate surrounding the Internet, community, and democracy.",
